CGFDM3D-EQR is a platform for rapid response to earthquake disasters in 3D complex media.
It can simulate seismic waves propagating in regional geological model in short time and can serve for post-earthquake quick response and earthquake hazard eveluation.
Comperhensively considering topogrophy, 3D complex media, and finite fault model, CGFDM3D-EQR can model an earthquake more realistically.
